         What's up Party People, it's your main man Donnie Dubs!  If you know me you know my heart belongs to two things: Kim Fey- who I guarantee I'll be with the rest of my life!- and BOSTON MASS BABY.  Singing is my work, my passion, and my dream.  Shout out to my brother Marky.  He's a great guy 'cause he knows I'll always be more famous than him and he's cool with it.  Word up!

         Hey out there, NKOTB-Heads!  Way cool of you to check out our stuff, like seriously.  It's not easy, even as famous as we are, to keep the momentum going day after day after day.  Sometimes I think about what it would be like if one day I decided just to not show up for a show, or a recording session, or a practice.  Would The Guys be able to keep working without me?  Am I replacable?  I don't even know the answer to that.  Anyway, cowabunga dudes!!

         Greetings, United States of America, this is Jordan Knight.  Simply astounding that you might bless our young "internet site" with your presence.  Tra la la!  Oh, pardon, that was just me warming up my instrument, aka my voice, aka the driving force behind New Kids on the Block.  Mark it down chaps, I said it.  The driving force.  As a side note, my publicist recently told me that I ought to listen to a series of diction and oratory cassettes, which appear to have effected the way that I speak.  Ta!

         Hey hey hey it's Jonathan Knight that's right that's right!  ...No, I'm not Jordan Knight.  Jonathan.  God why is that even still confusing people.  I'm JONATHAN Knight.  Anyway I'm from Worcester, Mass, home of the 25-Pound-Chili-Bowl-Challenge.  Eat it all and you get a t-shirt and your picture on the wall at Dave's Grub Shack!  Yeah you bet your butt my face is on that wall.  I may be the oldest member of New Kids, but I'm just as down to party as the rest of the gang.

         Hey all my name is Danny Wood.  I wanted to use today as an opportunity to answer a questiont that gets thrown at me all the time:  Yes, I'm in New Kids on the Block. To answer the follow up question I usually get: No, I can't prove it because any live concert footage that's ever been filmed has literally been the Jordan Knight Show and like, what am I supposed to do about that, quit the group?  That'd be like asking a turtle to quit his shell.  Woah, rad lyric!  I better tell our team of songwriters- I mean ourselves- about it!  Peace out!
